# node-react-full-stack-boilerplate
Boilerplate for a full stack project using nodejs (adonisJS), ReactJs as frontEnd, Mysql Database and Docker development based.

**You can skip docker part and execute everything in your machine** _But if you  are a good person keep going with docker ;)_

- Get docker
To install docker visit: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- Get docker compose
To install docker compose visit: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

- After get docker and compose, lets create docker containers
IMPORTANT: I've choosen a project name that will be used everywhere, in my example is just: `project` but you can change.


`$ docker-compose build`
`$ docker-compose up -d` _-d option run your containers in background_

- Now you have 
AdonisJS back-end up in `localhost:83`
ReactJS front-end up in `localhost:84`
